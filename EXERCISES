H1 (2015-02-16):
Write a program that opens a file for writing, truncates it, if it already exists, creates it, if it does not exist and writes the squares of integral number 0..99 into lines. The lines are 4 characters wide plus linefeed as fifth character. The output should be created using low-level I/O (open, write, close,...) and starting with the last square.

H2 (2015-02-23):
Write a program that works like a simplified version of less or more:
* read a file from command line or stdin (both need to work)
* react to keyboard input
* support vi style or emacs style or arrow keys (most difficult) or multiple of those for line up / line down
* optional: support character forward/backward, page down / page up, beginning/end of file or more
* always react on a single key without waiting for return to be pressed, unless return is your key for some function
* use tcgetattr and tcsetattr, possibly ioctl

H3 (2015-03-02):
Write a program that starts a daemon process for calculating squares:
* main forks child
* child forks daemon
* child ends itself
* parent observes termination of child
* a named pipe is used to communicate from parent to daemon that child has ended (for example by sending an "S" for "start")
* the same named pipe can then be used to send numbers to the daemon
* it will write the squares of the numbers to a file (or another named pipe) given on the command line
* sending "Q" or "QUIT" terminates the daemon
* other non-numberic messages are ignored
